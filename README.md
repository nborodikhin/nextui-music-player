## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Cross-compilation toolchain for ARM64
- NextUI workspace with platform dependencies

### Build Commands and Tools

```bash
# Build only
./dev build                            # desktop
./dev build brick tsps                 # tg5040 and tg5050

# Run host-side unit tests
./dev test

# Build, install, and run on connected devices
./dev devices
./dev install device
./dev install device dist/Music.Player.pak.zip   # install a prebuilt pak (no build)
./dev run device
./dev log device --follow

# Build a release folder and ZIP package using the distribution manifest
./dev dist all --strict

# Remove generated local build and distribution output
./dev clean

# Inspect or update release versions and changelog notes
./dev version latest
./dev version list

# Enter a toolchain or run a command in it
./dev docker 5040
./dev docker 5040 -- ls
./dev docker 5040 --podman -- ls
```

Platform aliases include `brick`, `brickpro`, `tsp`, `smartpro`, `5040`,
`tsps`, `smartpros`, and `5050`. Aliases ignore case, spaces, hyphens, and
underscores. An ADB serial can also be used wherever a device target is
accepted.

By default, install and run only update the binary.
Use `--full` to install the complete pak and `--delete` to remove stale files
from the installed pak before uploading it (userdata is not cleared).
Passing a path to a `.zip` pak alongside a device target skips the build and
installs that archive as a full pak (`--delete` still applies).
