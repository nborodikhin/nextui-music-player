✨ **Highlight Feature: Advanced Sleep Timer**  
This fork introduces a robust, highly requested **Sleep Timer**! Set the timer directly from the player menu. It works flawlessly in the background, accurately tracking your time even when the screen is turned off (lockscreen mode), and automatically suspends your device when the time is up. Perfect for listening to music, podcasts, or radio as you fall asleep!

## Supported Platforms
- **tg5040** - TrimUI Smart Pro / TrimUI Brick / Brick Hammer
- **tg5050** - TrimUI Smart Pro S
